During my 3 month internship, I gained valuable hands-on experience in cybersecurity investigations and analysis. I successfully completed many security investigations across endpoint, email, network, and cloud domains, developing my investigative skills and techniques.

Through attending internal training sessions and peer knowledge sharing, I expanded my understanding of malware identification, active directory attacks, and other cybersecurity topics.

Non-Technical Work
Alongside technical work, I participated in activities to develop professionally and engage with the cybersecurity community.

I consistently attended technical and non-technical training, including a 5-day Splunk administration course, to strengthen my skillset. Knowledge sharing with experienced teammates also allowed me to learn about real-world attacks.

Participating in Splunk's BOTS competition reinforced skills like collaboration, communication, and documentation when responding to security incidents.

I also connected with senior leaders through informational interviews and engagement events to get guidance on building a successful cybersecurity career.

Additionally, I volunteered at the UWS STEM festival, serving as a mentor in a cybersecurity workshop for high school students. This allowed me to develop my communication abilities while giving back to the community.

In summary, this well-rounded internship provided diverse hands-on experience and learning opportunities that will enable me to excel as I continue my cybersecurity career. I'm thankful for the growth in both my technical and professional abilities.
