During my 3 month internship, I gained valuable hands-on experience in cybersecurity investigations and analysis. I successfully completed many security investigations across endpoint, email, network, and cloud domains, developing my investigative skills and techniques.

Through attending internal training sessions and peer knowledge sharing, I expanded my understanding of malware identification, active directory attacks, and other cybersecurity topics.

Non-Technical Work
Training and Knowledge Sharing
I consistently attended technical and non-technical training offerings to expand my skills. For example, I completed a 5-day Splunk Power User training to better leverage Splunk in investigations. I also attended training on communication, time management, and other professional topics. Peer knowledge sharing events were valuable for learning from experienced teammates. I learned about real-world active directory attacks and malware through these discussions.

Competitions
I participated in Splunk's Boss of the SOC (BOTS) competition, an opportunity to apply my investigative skills in a simulated environment. My team was tasked with efficiently investigating and responding to a series of security incidents over 2 days. This high-pressure competition reinforced the need for collaboration, quick thinking, and effective documentation when responding to breaches.

Leadership Engagement
I had the chance to connect with senior leaders through informational interviews and a leader connect session. This allowed me to learn from their extensive experience and get their insights on building a successful cybersecurity career. They provided excellent advice on positioning myself for future roles and responsibilities.

Community Outreach
I volunteered at the UWS STEM festival, participating in an interactive workshop to teach high school girls about cybersecurity. I served as a mentor, walking through an encryption decoding exercise and explaining key cybersecurity concepts like CIA - confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Events like these allowed me to give back to the community while developing my communication abilities.

In summary, this internship provided me with diverse hands-on cybersecurity experience that strengthened my technical and professional skills. I am grateful for the learning opportunities that will enable me to excel in my future career protecting critical systems and data.
