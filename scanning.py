Technical Work

Over the past month, I have accomplished several technical goals and learned many new skills. I completed compliance and security trainings on topics like cloud threats, threat hunting, and digital forensics. These expanded my knowledge across key security domains.

In the security operations center, I investigated nearly a dozen network and email alerts. I followed procedures to isolate systems, collect forensics, and identify root causes. In one case, I pinpointed communication to a malicious domain and helped block it environment-wide. These investigations improved my alert triage and analysis abilities.

I also attended trainings on personal branding, investigation techniques, security tools, and more. A notable session demonstrated forensic techniques for browser artifacts, showing me a new source of valuable user data. I look forward to applying these skills during future investigations.

Non-Technical Work

Beyond technical work, I gained exposure to the company's culture and strategy. I attended organizational town halls and management sessions. These provided insights into senior leaders' experiences and company direction.

I appreciated the networking opportunities which allowed me to expand professional relationships. The sessions were invaluable for understanding the company's priorities and work environment.

Challenges

While the internship has been rewarding, I faced some challenges along the way. Early on, I struggled with inconsistent documentation during investigations. However, based on supervisor feedback, I identified areas to improve including more concise and standardized note taking.

I also found email header analysis complex at first. But after hands-on practice and training, I became more capable with parsing headers to validate emails. I will continue working to master email analysis techniques.

Overall, these challenges ultimately helped me develop new skills. By recognizing my weaknesses, I could set clear goals to level up those abilities. The roadblocks kept me humble and drove me to continuously improve.
